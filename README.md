# ATL - A Typed Language

What you can do in ATL:

```
sum(tree) {
    switch (tree) {
        case 'Leaf: // the ' notation is a shorthand for string, 'Leaf == "Leaf"
            return 1;
        case ('Branch, l, r):
            return sum(l) + sum(r);
    }
}
```

Looks trivial for a typical dynamic language, but the plot twist is that ATL is statically typed.
In fact it fully type checks:

```
tree : Tree = {'Leaf} ∪ Branch
'Leaf : {'Leaf} <: String
1 : {1} <: Int
'Branch : {'Branch} <: String
l : L = Tree
r : R = Tree
('Branch, l, r) : {'Branch} × Tree × Tree
+ : `+ = Int, Int -> Int
sum(l) + sum(r) : Int
sum : Sum = Tree -> Int
```

It's worth mentioning that, the type `Tree` is inferred by the type checker, rather than defined.
In ATL, programs can't define types; but rather types are inferred by the values that inhabitates.

Since the type `Sum` doesn't contain any quantifiers, it is regarded as a fact. Thus, if the
following code tries to pass in an incompatible type, it will complain:

```
var x; // x : ⊤
sum(x); // not ok, ⊤ is not a subtype of Tree
```

How is it different from TypeScript?

Example:
```
mod2(n) {
    if (n < 2) {
        return n;
    } else {
        mod2(n - 2);
    }
}

var x;
var a = 8;
if (mod2(a) == 0) {
    x = 1;
} else {
    x = 3;
}
var y = x + a;
```

What would be the type of `y`?

The type checker roughly follows:
1. We observe the relation `mod2(n)`: it is a recursive function with one base case and one 
inductive hypothesis
2. Combined with the precondition `n < 2`, the return type can only be a subtype of `{0, 1}`
3. In `mod2(a) == 0`, `{0} <: {0, 1}`, there exists an equality relation
4. For the precondition of `x = 1`, `mod2(a) == 0`
  1. It implies that for the base case of `mod2`, `n = 0`
  2. The members that inhabitates the return type is generated by the only one base case and 
  inductive case.
  3. If the base case t₀ is a subtype of `Int`, and IH is a map from any t₁ ∈ T to t₂ ∈ T,
then T ∈ `Int`. 
  4. 3) is true, proved by the existence of `n = 0` and the map `n - 2`
  5. Thus the return type is `{0, 2, 4, ...}`
  6. `{8} <: {0, 2, 4, ...}`, thus `mod2(a) == 0` is always true
  7. Similarly, the opposite is always false
5. Now we focus on the `if` statement. 
  The program flow can only take the `if_true` path, thus the program is equivalent to 
  `var x; x = 1;`
6. The type for x in this case is `{1}`
7. The only inhabitants of `{1}` and `{8}` are `1` and `8`, so the range of `+` is `{1+8} = {9}`
8. `y : {9}`
